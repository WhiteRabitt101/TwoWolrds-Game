Let us go to a World far away, a world united under one ruling force, a World that functions as if it were a military complex.

People still laugh, learn, love,and lose, but with a Strange Order. Art and music still exist, but they are hollow and estranged, not like here on Earth. 
This world learned the hard way:
Without order chaos rises and as it does all can come undone. 
        



This world is like any other intelligent world, 
It contains an as wide and diverse group of humaniods as one can imagine,
and not all fit in to this neat and orderly life.



       
Sad to say those who do not function well within the Society ...
They don't do so well..... (to keep it PG)

Fast forward about 1000 years into this Society and discover that this perfect world, with all its control, has created a new chaos.
Some decided that they want to be free from that control and order!

That is were you come in.

You are an up and coming soldier in this Worlds Society, will you stay and bring back 'order' to this World?
Or will you free this World and let 'chaos' usher in a new era?

the choice is yours... :P
